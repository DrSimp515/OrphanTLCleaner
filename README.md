## OrphanTLCleaner

**OrphanTLCleaner** is a tool designed to clean up orphaned translations in Ren'Py projects. It allows you to scan through `.rpy` and `.rpym` files and either remove or comment out translation blocks that are no longer in use, based on a `lint.txt` file generated by Ren'Py. The application also supports multiple languages and includes options for both light and dark themes.

### Features:
- **Multilingual Support:** Easily switch between languages like English, Spanish, French, Japanese, and more.
- **Dark Mode:** Toggle between light and dark themes for a more comfortable user experience.
- **Comment Mode:** Instead of deleting orphaned translation blocks, you can choose to comment them out for easier revision later.
- **File Processing:** Quickly process entire directories of `.rpy` and `.rpym` files to clean up unused translations.

### Installation:

3. Run the application:

### How It Works:

2. Choose the `lint.txt` file generated by Ren'Py's linting tool.
3. Input the target translation language (e.g., "english").
4. Run the tool to clean up orphaned translations, with the option to comment them out instead of removing them.
